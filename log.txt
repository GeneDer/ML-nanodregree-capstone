process:

- search for possible methods to solve the problem. One being doing more research on the faster R-CNN. Another being simply train 2 models, one for detecting the possible region for the digit with edgebox or selective search, second for classification for the digit with CNN.

- downloaded data and coded a matlab code to convert .mat into txt for python usage later.

- reading paper and possibly clean data into a better format.

- current options: selective search + cnn to classifiy 
		    directly use faster rcnn from the paper
		    cnn for number of numbers + localization cnn
		    use other people's imlementation of RoI layer to make faster rcnn
			
- attempt to train number of numbers, locations of the boxes, and the class of each number. Prepare to saparate images into different lengths to train the first model.
